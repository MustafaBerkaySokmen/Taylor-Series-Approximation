# Taylor Series Approximation

## Overview
The **Taylor Series Approximation** program computes the value of `cos(x)` using the Taylor series expansion. It allows users to input a value for `x` and specify the number of terms to be considered in the series.

## Features
- Uses Taylor Series to approximate `cos(x)`.
- Accepts user input for `x` and the number of terms in the expansion.
- Computes factorial values internally for accurate calculations.
- Outputs the approximated `cos(x)` value.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taylor-series.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd taylor-series
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python TaylorSeries.py
   ```

## Usage
1. The program will prompt the user for:
   - **x**: The value for which `cos(x)` is to be computed.
   - **terms**: The number of terms to be used in the Taylor series expansion.
2. The program computes the result using the Taylor series formula.
3. The approximated value of `cos(x)` is displayed.

## Example Output
```
Enter the value of x: 1.0
Enter the value of terms: 5
0.540302
```
